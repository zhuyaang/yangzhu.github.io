    <span class="post-date">Master Candidate @ SWUFE</span>

    <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a Master student in <strong>Marketing Management</strong> at 
    <a href="https://www.swufe.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE)</a>, China.</p>
    
    <p>My research interests lie in the intersection of <strong>Behavioral Economics</strong> and Marketing. 
    I am particularly interested in how social norms and reciprocity shape consumer decision-making.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am focusing on building my skills in <strong>Python for Data Analysis</strong> and experimental design.</p>
