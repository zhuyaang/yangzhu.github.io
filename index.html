        Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a Master student in <strong>Marketing Management</strong> at 
        <a href="https://www.swufe.edu.cn/">Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE)</a>, China.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My research interests lie in the intersection of <strong>Behavioral Economics</strong> and Marketing. 
        I am particularly interested in how social norms and reciprocity shape consumer decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am working on projects related to <strong>Python for Data Analysis</strong> and experimental design.
